:::warning Caution

Ripple provides the [Testnet and Devnet](/docs/concepts/understanding-xrpl/networks/parallel-networks.md) for testing purposes only, and sometimes resets the state of these test networks along with all balances. As a precaution, **do not** use the same addresses on Testnet/Devnet and Mainnet.
